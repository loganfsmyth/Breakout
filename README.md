# Breakout

It's a right of passage for developers to write a breakout game, right?

I wrote this in early 2009 when I decided I wanted to learn C++ and OpenGL. As with most things I've written in the past, looking back at this code makes me twitch, but I figured it'd be fun to put it up somewhere. I reconstructed some of the history from various backups that I have, but I wasn't using version control back then.

Obviously there are many things that could be done better, but I'd say it is one of the more completed games I've written since I tend to get distracted once I've acheived my main goals of learning new stuff.
